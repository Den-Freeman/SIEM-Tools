#Here’s an example of a simple UDM search that uses the event metadata field to locate events relating to user logins:
#metadata.event_type = “USER_LOGIN”: This UDM field metadata.event_type contains information about the event type.
#This includes information like timestamp, network connection, user authentication, and more.
#Here, the event type specifies USER_LOGIN, which searches for events relating to authentication.

$metadata.event_type = “USER_LOGIN”
